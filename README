nudaDB README

TODO
[X] make path saved in table relative to directory holding nudaDB.py, to allow use on removable memory
[X] use file timestamp if no EXIF data
[X] for import, display image on screen and then prompt for tags
[X] for import, keep focus on terminal, autoclose displayed image after tags are entered
[ ] for import, suggest tags (autofill suggestions from previously used tags)
[ ] check entire db for duplicate files on import? (no, use a separate command, perhaps "status")
[ ] ability to search db and display images and edit tags
[ ] implement optparse (nope, keep git-style commands)
[ ] add command line option to keep file in inbox upon successful import
[X] allow wildcards on command line
[X] save previously entered tag-string history, accessible with up arrow (importing readline makes raw_input do this automatically)
[X] change name to nudusDB/nudaDB/nudumDB. ('nudus' is latin for simple/unadorned/bare)
[X] make it 'standalone' executable
[X] make 'install' command to add it to bin and create ./inbox/ and ./inbox/imported/ directories
[ ] write real README
[X] implement tag dictionary for searching
[X] test ability to gracefully abort importing
[X] move collision checking and skip before prompt for tags
[ ] save a thumbnail of each imported image for less RAM-intensive browsing?
[X] python3 compatibility (probably no longer python2 compatible...)
[ ] windows compatibility
[ ] OSX compatibility
[ ] browser-based client?
	[ ] how easy is it to write a front-end in something like Dash?
[ ] make search succeed on partial matches
[ ] full regex implementation (optional)?
[ ] config file (.nudarc) for specifying optional behaviors
[ ] commandline option to specify a default tag string which will be preloaded on the Entry bar with each picture during import
[ ] gracefully handle a file missing
[ ] ability to pause and resume the slideshow
[ ] fix bug when last file of import is a collision (tag input window doesn't close itself)
[X] slideshow: shuffle all matching images

Ideas
[ ] change name to 'fresco'
	or 'rat' (Rapid Album Tagger)
	or 'itad' (Image Tag and Display)
	or 'sat' (Simple Album Tagger)
	rapid fast simple easy tag display present show slide-show album gallery 
	or 'hycom' (Hyrule Compendium), or name it after the Lab director or assistant
[ ] fill inbox from external media feature
	-search computer for external media
	-find 'DCIM' directories
	-copy files in DCIM directories into fresco inbox
[X] slideshow feature
	-start a slideshow of all images matching a given tag list
NOPE	-default: only use the tag "show", tag favorite images with "show" so that they appear in slideshow
[ ] consider possible raspberrypi/raspbian optimizations
	-best possible layman-deployment vector
